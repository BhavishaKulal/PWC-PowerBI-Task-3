# PWC-PowerBI-Task-3 : Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard
This project presents a Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard focusing on key metrics across hiring, promotions, performance ratings, and turnover rates. The dashboard is designed to analyze gender disparities in the workplace, particularly in leadership roles, and to identify areas for improvement.

## Objectives:
**Define KPIs**: Identify and define relevant KPIs that provide insights into gender diversity, hiring, promotion trends, performance ratings, and turnover across the organization.

**Create Dashboard**: Develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that visualizes these KPIs, making it easy for leadership and HR teams to understand gender disparities and inclusion challenges at different levels of the organization.

**Analyze Trends**: Provide clear analysis on how gender diversity affects hiring, promotions, and turnover, allowing stakeholders to assess the current state of diversity and inclusion.

**Highlight Areas for Improvement**: Identify critical areas where progress is slow or gender imbalances persist, such as executive-level promotions and retention of senior women.

**Provide Recommendations**: Offer actionable recommendations based on dashboard insights to guide policy development, improve gender diversity in leadership roles, and enhance retention strategies for women.

## Problem Statement
The company is aiming to achieve greater gender diversity, particularly in higher-level roles, while ensuring equal performance ratings and retention rates across all employee segments. However, the data suggests slower progress in achieving gender parity in hiring, promotions, and executive roles.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this task was presented by [Pwc](https://www.pwc.com) and the call centre trends dataset:

- **Dataset**: [Diversity Inclusion Datset]([03 Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/BhavishaKulal/PWC-PowerBI-Task-3/blob/main/03%20Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx))

## Data Visualization (Dashboard)

## Insights
**1. Gender Disparity in Hiring and Promotions**:
Only 41% of hires were women, indicating a gender imbalance in recruitment.
Promotion rates also reflect a gender gap, with men receiving a higher number of promotions across various job levels.
**2. Executive Roles Gender Split**:
Executive positions are predominantly occupied by males (87.5% in FY20).
Female representation in promotions to executive roles remains low, signifying slower progress towards gender parity at the top levels.
**3. Performance Ratings**:
The average performance rating for women (2.42) is slightly higher than that for men (2.41). This suggests that performance might not be a limiting factor for female employees' progression in the company.
**4. Turnover Rates**:
Higher turnover rates in managerial and senior positions may affect gender diversity efforts. It's unclear if this turnover is gender-specific, but managing retention is key to sustaining diversity.
**5. Age Group Distribution**:
Employees in the 20-29 age group form the largest segment, which could provide an opportunity for gender diversity initiatives to focus on early-career professionals.
**6. Hiring Gaps by Job Level**:
Women are underrepresented in hiring for senior-level roles, with a significant drop at the manager level (17.86% female vs. 82.14% male).
**7. Promotions Discrepancy**:
Promotions at executive and director levels show a gender disparity, as the number of promotions for men outweighs those for women.
**8. Areas for Improvement**:
Increase female representation in hiring, particularly at senior and executive levels.
Address barriers to promotion for women, as performance does not seem to be a limiting factor.
