# PWC-PowerBI-Task-3 : Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard
This project presents a Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard focusing on key metrics across hiring, promotions, performance ratings, and turnover rates. The dashboard is designed to analyze gender disparities in the workplace, particularly in leadership roles, and to identify areas for improvement.

## Objectives:
**Define KPIs**: Identify and define relevant KPIs that provide insights into gender diversity, hiring, promotion trends, performance ratings, and turnover across the organization.
**Create Dashboard**: Develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that visualizes these KPIs, making it easy for leadership and HR teams to understand gender disparities and inclusion challenges at different levels of the organization.

**Analyze Trends**: Provide clear analysis on how gender diversity affects hiring, promotions, and turnover, allowing stakeholders to assess the current state of diversity and inclusion.

**Highlight Areas for Improvement**: Identify critical areas where progress is slow or gender imbalances persist, such as executive-level promotions and retention of senior women.

**Provide Recommendations**: Offer actionable recommendations based on dashboard insights to guide policy development, improve gender diversity in leadership roles, and enhance retention strategies for women.

## Problem Statement
The company is aiming to achieve greater gender diversity, particularly in higher-level roles, while ensuring equal performance ratings and retention rates across all employee segments. However, the data suggests slower progress in achieving gender parity in hiring, promotions, and executive roles.
